I'll help you run the WPG amenities website page. Let me first explore the project structure to understand how to serve it.

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined â€¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

I can see this is a static website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `public` directory. Let me check if there's a development server setup in the package.json:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Perfect! The project has scripts configured to run a local development server. I can see there are three options (`start`, `serve`, or `dev`) that all use Python's built-in HTTP server. Let me run the development server:

---

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

Great! The development server is now running in the background. The website should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. 

The WPG amenities website is now running! Here's what's happening:

- **Server**: Python's built-in HTTP server is serving the static files from the `public` directory
- **URL**: The website is accessible at `http://localhost:8000`
- **Technology**: This is a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript website that dynamically loads content from `data/content.yml`

You can now:
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Browse the WPG amenities website with all its pages (home, products, about, contact, etc.)

The server will continue running in the background until you stop it. If you need to stop the server, just let me know and I can help you terminate the process.
